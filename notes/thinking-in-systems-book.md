# "Thinking in Systems: A Primer" book notes


## Highlights

- The best way to deduce the system’s purpose is to watch for a while to see how the system behaves.  
  
---
  
- some systems are more than surprising. They are perverse. These are the systems that are structured in ways that produce truly problematic behavior;  
  
---
  
- If there is a discrepancy, each actor does something to correct the situation. Usually the greater the discrepancy between the goal and the actual situation, the more emphatic the action will be.
- Intensification of anyone’s effort leads to intensification of everyone else’s. It’s hard to reduce the intensification.
- This is what happened in 1933 when Prohibition ended in the United States; the alcohol-driven chaos also largely ended.
- If everyone can work harmoniously toward the same outcome (if all feedback loops are serving the same goal), the results can be amazing.

---

- THE TRAP: POLICY RESISTANCE When various actors try to pull a system stock toward various goals, the result can be policy resistance. Any new policy, especially if it’s effective, just pulls the stock farther from the goals of other actors and produces additional resistance, with a result that no one likes, but that everyone expends considerable effort in maintaining. THE WAY OUT Let go. Bring in all the actors and use the energy formerly expended on resistance to seek out mutually satisfactory ways for all goals to be realized—or redefinitions of larger and more important goals that everyone can pull toward together.

---

- If the users follow the bounded rationality of the commons (“There’s no reason for me to be the one to limit my cows!”), there is no reason for any of them to decrease their use.

---

- Common resources protected only by tradition or an “honor system” may attract those who do not respect the tradition or who have no honor. Privatization works more reliably than exhortation, if society is willing to let some individuals learn the hard way. But many resources, such as the atmosphere and the fish of the sea, simply cannot be privatized. That leaves only the option of “mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon.”

---

- Educate and exhort the users, so they understand the consequences of abusing the resource. And also restore or strengthen the missing feedback link, either by privatizing the resource so each user feels the direct consequences of its abuse or (since many resources cannot be privatized) by regulating the access of all users to the resource.

---

- tragic archetype, the desired state of the system is influenced by the perceived state.
- “Well, we’re not doing much worse than we were last year.” “Well, look around, everybody else is having trouble too.”
- Allowing performance standards to be influenced by past performance, especially if there is a negative bias in perceiving past performance, sets up a reinforcing feedback loop of eroding goals that sets a system drifting toward low performance.
- Keep performance standards absolute. Even better, let standards be enhanced by the best actual performances instead of being discouraged by the worst. Use the same structure to set up a drift toward high performance!
- The best way out of this trap is to avoid getting in it. If caught in an escalating system, one can refuse to compete (unilaterally disarm),

---

- SUCCESS TO THE SUCCESSFUL: If the winners of a competition are systematically rewarded with the means to win again, a reinforcing feedback loop is created by which, if it is allowed to proceed uninhibited, the winners eventually take all, while the losers are eliminated.
- Diversification, which allows those who are losing the competition to get out of that game and start another one;

----

- If the goals—the indicators of satisfaction of the rules—are defined inaccurately or incompletely, the system may obediently work to produce a result that is not really intended or wanted.
- Specify indicators and goals that reflect the real welfare of the system. Be especially careful not to confuse effort with result or you will end up with a system that is producing effort, not result.
- although people deeply involved in a system often know intuitively where to find leverage points, more often than not they push the change in the wrong direction.

---

- Counterintuitive—that’s Forrester’s word to describe complex systems. Leverage points frequently are not intuitive.
- As systems become complex, their behavior can become surprising.

---

- Delays in feedback loops are critical determinants of system behavior. They are common causes of oscillations.
- if there is a delay in your system that can be changed, changing it can have big effects.

---

- The strength of a balancing feedback loop is important relative to the impact it is designed to correct. If the impact increases in strength, the feedbacks have to be strengthened too.
- A balancing feedback loop is self-correcting; a reinforcing feedback loop is self-reinforcing.
- A system with an unchecked reinforcing loop ultimately will destroy itself.

---

- Missing information flows is one of the most common causes of system malfunction. Adding or restoring information can be a powerful intervention, usually much easier and cheaper than rebuilding physical infrastructure.

---

- The rules of the system define its scope, its boundaries, its degrees of freedom.

---

- Self-organization means changing any aspect of a system lower on this list—adding completely new physical structures, such as brains or wings or computers—adding new balancing or reinforcing loops, or new rules.
- complex and delightful patterns can evolve from quite simple sets of rules.
- Even people within systems don’t often recognize what whole-system goal they are serving. “To make profits,” most corporations would say, but that’s just a rule, a necessary condition to stay in the game.

---

- Social systems are the external manifestations of cultural thinking patterns and of profound human needs, emotions, strengths, and weaknesses. Changing them is not as simple as saying “now all change,” or of trusting that he who knows the good shall do the good.
- Self-organizing, nonlinear, feedback systems are inherently unpredictable. They are not controllable. They are understandable only in the most general way. The goal of foreseeing the future exactly and preparing for it perfectly is unrealizable. The idea of making a complex system do just what you want it to do can be achieved only temporarily, at best.
- Systems can’t be controlled, but they can be designed and redesigned.
- Before you disturb the system in any way, watch how it behaves.
- Starting with the behavior of the system forces you to focus on facts, not theories. It keeps you from falling too quickly into your own beliefs or misconceptions, or those of others.

- Use Language with Care and Enrich It with Systems Concepts
- Our information streams are composed primarily of language. Our mental models are mostly verbal. Honoring information means above all avoiding language pollution

---

- A society that talks incessantly about “productivity” but that hardly understands, much less uses, the word “resilience” is going to become productive and not resilient. A society that doesn’t understand or use the term “carrying capacity” will exceed its carrying capacity.
- No one can define or measure justice, democracy, security, freedom, truth, or love. No one can define or measure any value. But if no one speaks up for them, if systems aren’t designed to produce them, if we don’t speak about them and point toward their presence or absence, they will cease to exist.

---

- Remember that hierarchies exist to serve the bottom layers, not the top. Don’t maximize parts of systems or subsystems while ignoring the whole.

---

- “Intrinsic responsibility” means that the system is designed to send feedback about the consequences of decision making directly and quickly and compellingly to the decision makers.

---
- Working with systems, on the computer, in nature, among people, in organizations, constantly reminds me of how incomplete my mental models are, how complex the world is, and how much I don’t know.

---

- We can, and some of us do, celebrate and encourage self-organization, disorder, variety, and diversity. Some of us even make a moral code of doing so, as Aldo Leopold did with his land ethic: “A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.”

---

- In spite of what you majored in, or what the textbooks say, or what you think you’re an expert at, follow a system wherever it leads. It will be sure to lead across traditional disciplinary lines.

---

- The real system is interconnected.
